# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
The **Customer Churn Prediction** project is a machine learning-based solution designed to identify customers who are likely to discontinue a service or subscription. Predicting churn helps companies take proactive measures to retain valuable customers, thereby improving customer satisfaction and business profitability.

This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data, identify behavioral patterns, and accurately forecast churn probability.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
- Understand the key factors influencing customer churn.
- Enable businesses to take preventive retention measures.
- Integrate predictive insights into CRM systems for real-time decision-making.

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset used contains details about customer demographics, account information, and service usage.  
Typical features include:
- **Customer ID**
- **Gender**
- **Tenure**
- **Contract Type**
- **Payment Method**
- **Monthly Charges**
- **Total Charges**
- **Churn (Target Variable)**

## 🧩 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Import the dataset and explore its structure.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize correlations and identify churn trends.  
4. **Model Training** – Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
6. **Prediction & Insights** – Predict churn and provide actionable insights.

## 📊 Results
The best-performing model achieved high accuracy and balanced precision-recall scores, effectively identifying customers at risk of churning. These predictions can be used to design customer retention campaigns.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate deep learning models (e.g., ANN for improved accuracy).  
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time churn prediction.  
- Include customer feedback sentiment analysis to enrich prediction accuracy.
